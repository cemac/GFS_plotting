# GFS_plotting

This document gives an overview of the setup required to run the SWIFT GFS python plotting code originally written by Alexander Roberts (NCAS and University of Leeds). This document will: (1) introduce the general structure of the code, (2) explain the supporting scripts including system requirements, (3) explain individual python plotting scripts and (4) describe the operation of the scripts together. This should give all the details needed to understand this repository and allow you to download and use the code for yourself.
